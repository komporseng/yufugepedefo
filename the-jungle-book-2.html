The Lion King is scheduled to open in theaters on July 19, which means Favreau might begin production on The Jungle Book 2 later this year.</p><p>However, as he explained to Collider in December 2016, the film’s photorealistic CGI is a “slow process.”</p><p>“Rushing things is not a smart idea since when people respond negatively to visual effects, it is frequently because they were rushed.”</p><p>Therefore, even if he does begin work on it this year, do not anticipate a sequel in 2020. Fortunately, Disney has a slew of “Live-Action” film release dates for 2021, and beyond that, it can fit into.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Jungle-Book-2.jpg><h2>The Jungle Book 2 Plot</h2><p>While Favreau has been hard at work on The Lion King, returning writer Justin Marks has teased the sequel’s approach.</p><p>“In the second film, the aim is to delve further into the Kipling and some of the Disney resources from the 1967 picture that didn’t make it into the first film,” he explained to Slash Film.</p><p>“When it comes to Bill Peet’s work on the original picture, most of which was discarded by Walt Disney, Jon and I dug deep into the Disney archives to examine some of the concepts. We were like, ‘Wait a minute, that’s an excellent concept. That is an absolute need for the picture’. As a result, we’ve constructed it in this manner.”</p><p>Of course, much of the original Kipling stories have not yet been seen on screen, just as the first film presented stories not included in the animation.</p><p>Could the sequel include Mowgli in the world of men?</p><h2>The Jungle Book 2 Cast</h2><p>We won’t know the sequel’s cast until Favreau begins working on it in earnest, but Neel Sethi should return as Mowgli… as long as he hasn’t grown up too much.</p><p>The voice cast should remain the same as long as their characters return, which means Bill Murray will reprise his role as Baloo, Ben Kingsley will reprise his role as Bagheera, and Lupita Nyong’o will reprise her role as Raksha. Scarlett Johansson will reprise her role as Kaa.</p><h2>The Jungle Book 2 trailer</h2><p>Proceed with caution; there will most likely be nothing to see here until at least 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpa2dgaXxygo6tn55lmqq7qLjEZpmop5tif3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./soupachu.html><span>←</span><span>soupachu- Age, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career, Nationality</span></a>
