The T. rex has earned a legacy as one of the most formidable predators in history. With a bite force equal to getting smashed by three cars, none of us ever envied the people in the Jurassic Park jeeps.
Now, though, a cutting-edge study shows that the ruler of the dinosaur kingdom confined his cardio to a brisk walk."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

And if the 40-foot-long dinosaur tried too hard to catch up (going 13 miles per hour, say) paleontologist William Sellers says the creature’s bones would have shattered.</p><p>Previous studies, Sellers <a href=#>explained</a>, had been conducted under the assumption that T. rex’s muscles would be the only thing holding back her cardio capabilities.</p><p>“This study uses the assumption that at maximum speed, the muscles weren’t the limiting factor,” Williams said. “At the previously proposed top speed, T. rex would have shattered foot bones, according to this model.”</p><p>But, some might say, the omniscient powers that be in <a href=#>Hollywood</a> told us that these things are deadly:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K55ywJ_wD64</p><p>Apparently, though, paleontologists have known for awhile that their subjects were being inaccurately portrayed to the masses.</p><p>“The movie image of T. rex is wrong,” Brusatte said. “Paleontologists have realized this for over a decade now, and this new study drives it home by providing the most sophisticated computer modeling studies yet.”</p><p>Still, scientists don’t see directors changing their T. rex approach anytime soon.</p><p>“It has to be fast or else it won’t be cool,” Hutchinson admitted.</p><p>Example A:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8OiM4_06As</p><p>Next, read about <a href=#>the dinosaur mummy recently found with skin and guts intact</a>.
