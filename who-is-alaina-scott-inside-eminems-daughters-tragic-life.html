The wedding took place in Detroit, Michigan, alongside 125 of their closest family and friends. Alaina’s sister Hailie Jade was a bridesmaid for the joyous occasion.</p><p>“June 9, 2023, simply one of the best days of my life🤍 in this lifetime and in the next, my soul will always find yours🌹,” Alaina <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">raved over her nuptials</a> on social media alongside snapshots of the event.</p><p>The beaming bride had her happiest day, but she lived through a troubled upbringing in her younger years.

She wanted to let Dawn go.”</p><p>Like Alaina’s mother Dawn, Eminem had his own struggles with addiction. He has been <a href=#>sober</a> since 2007 after overdosing on methadone, and he credits his children with helping him stay on the straight and narrow. In 2010, he gave <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the New York Times</a>&nbsp;an interview about his battle with addiction.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Eminem’s ex-wife, Kim Scott, gave birth to his only biological daughter, Hailie, in 1995. <span class=credit>Corbis via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“I didn’t know it was methadone. I used to get pills wherever I could,”&nbsp;he said. “I was just taking anything that anybody was giving to me.”</p><p>The rapper added that his family has been supportive of his sobriety. “I love them so much and they’ve helped me through so many things,” he said.</p><p>Eminem is a father of three.
