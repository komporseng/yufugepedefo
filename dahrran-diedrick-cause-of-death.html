He won the Grey Cup three times, with the Edmonton Eskimos in 2005 and the Montreal Alouettes in 2009 and 2010.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He spent the majority of his 10 seasons in the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Alouettes, and he also played in the National Football League (NFL) with the San Diego Chargers, Green Bay Packers, and Washington Redskins. After a redshirt season in 1998, Diedrick played collegiate football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers from 1999 to 2002.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He had 502 carries for 2,745 yards and 26 touchdowns in four years, with 1,299 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns in 2001 being particularly notable. Diedrick was selected by the Edmonton Eskimos in the third round of the 2002 CFL Draft, 24th overall, but he chose to continue his senior year in high school.</p><p style=text-align:justify>After going undrafted in the 2003 NFL Draft, Diedrick was signed by the San Diego Chargers after his college career was over. He also played with the Washington Redskins and the Green Bay Packers, for whom he played one regular-season game in 2004.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Dahrran Diedrick Death Cause: CFL Star Battle With Cancer</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Dahrran Diedrick, a former Washington running back, died at the age of 44 from cancer. As previously stated, his death was reported by the Montreal Alouettes, a CFL team with whom he won two Grey Cups, through his family.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Diedrick was Nebraska’s first Canadian-born scholarship recruit. In his first season with the Cornhuskers, he rushed for 1,299 yards and a Big 12-leading 15 touchdowns. During the 2014 CFL season, hepatosplenic gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma, an extremely rare and aggressive type of the disease that starts in the spleen or liver, was determined to be Diedrick’s condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dahrran-Diedrick-Cause-Of-Death-2.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>He had a stem cell transplant with Dominique, his 20-year-old daughter, as the donor. The condition’s symptoms vanished after 15 months. However, not long after the surgery, the CFL great passed away following a long fight with cancer.</p>CFL Commissioner Randy Ambrosie stated, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the friends, family, and former coaches and teammates of Dahrran Diedrick during this terrible time. “Cancer tragically took another life.” <strong>You can see a tweet below:</strong><p dir=ltr lang=en>Our thoughts and prayers are with the friends, family, and former coaches and teammates of Dahrran Diedrick during this difficult time.

On June 24, 2023. Because his death was only announced a few hours ago, the running back’s formal obituary may take some time to post on the internet. The obituary has yet to be issued by the family or the club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dahrran-Diedrick-Cause-Of-Death-1.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>However, we can assume that the funeral would be held by his family in Jamaica or in Ontario, where he passed away. The star will also be cremated at a neighboring crematorium. In dealing with this loss, his family, friends, and the community will draw solace from memories of the former Alouettes running back’s tremendous career.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Everyone was shocked by the NFL star’s death, and there are numerous internet temples dedicated to his memory. A few well-known figures, including his previous club, have also expressed their condolences to his family. At this time, the Diedrick family will need time to mourn the loss of the former FAI treasurer.</p><p><strong>If you want to read more posts related to death then you can check out our below posts:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Doreen Dougherty Death and Obituary: The Truth Behind Her Passing!</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Alyssa Fluet Cause of Death: Reason Behind Her Demise</a></li></ul><p style=text-align:justify>For more information about what happened near you, such as death news, cause of death, autopsy reports, obituaries, and more, please visit our website,<strong> <a class=ab-item href=# aria-haspopup=true>The Current Online</a>,</strong> and read our other recent postings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX5muqb7RmqVmnJmasbO1wqRknJmlqLJuu8Vmm56ZpJ18doCQb2ho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./thoughty2.html><span>←</span><span>Thoughty2</span></a>
