At a young age, she played a special role in announcing her parents' engagement to the world.</p><p class=dh>Linda Cardellini is undoubtedly a talented and beautiful actress known for her roles in "Freaks and Geeks," "ER," "Bloodline," and "Dead to Me." Since her rise to fame, many have been curious about her personal life, especially when she had a child.</p><p class=dh>The actress was in her later 30s when she welcomed her first daughter, Lilah-Rose Rodriguez. Although Lilah-Rose is still young, there are some details known about her.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Lilah-Rose Rodriguez Can Celebrate Her Birthday Only Once in 4 Years</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In October 2011, Cardellini's representative confirmed the actress' <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/linda-cardellini-expecting-first-child/>pregnancy</a> with her then-boyfriend, Steven Rodriguez. Although not yet married at that time, the couple was already excited to grow their family.</p><p class=dh>Lilah-Rose arrived on a special day, one that only comes every four years. On February 29, 2012, Cardellini and Rodriguez welcomed their first child in what the doting mom <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/linda-cardellini-welcomes-daughter-lilah-rose/>called</a> "a wonderful, thrilling event." She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/linda-cardellini-welcomes-daughter-lilah-rose/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I think you can't help but be slightly terrified because somebody's whole life will be in your hands."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Lilah-Rose and Her Mother Are Lucky to Be Alive Following Complicated Birth</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Lilah-Rose entered the world with great difficulty, having had a complicated birth. Cardellini previously revealed that her pregnancy and delivery were traumatic and dangerous. The actress was diagnosed with pneumonia and several other complications in her ninth month.</p><p class=dh>Things worsened during labor, and Cardellini had to undergo an emergency c-section. "[Lilah-Rose's] heart rate dropped, and she had the umbilical cord around her neck," Cardellini <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/linda-cardellini-csection-delivery-thyroid-problem/>revealed</a>.</p><p class=dh>Although Lilah-Rose survived, her mother experienced a thyroid issue that needed immediate medical treatment. However, after the storm passed, the new mom saw Lilah-Rose as her ray of sunshine.</p><p class=dh>At 14 months old, Cardellini described her daughter as an extrovert who tries to communicate with adults. She would point at the clothes she wanted to wear and express her likes and dislikes through actions instead of words.</p><p class=dh>Lilah-Rose certainly changed Cardelliini's life, making her realize that she could love unconditionally in a way she never thought she could. She has also become more protective, by instinct, towards her daughter.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Lilah-Rose's Little Hand Became an Announcement for the World</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Lilah-Rose's parents met when Cardellini was only ten years old, and Steven was 11, both studying in the same elementary school. Although their love story did not begin immediately, they reconnected years later and eventually fell in love.</p><p class=dh>The foundation of their relationship is built on years of friendship, making their bond incredibly strong. Like Cardellini, Steven was an actor known for "Saved by the Bell" and "Pacific Blue." However, he discontinued his acting career in the early 2000s.</p><p class=dh>In 2013, the couple took their relationship up a notch with the help of Lilah-Rose. Cardellini posted the news of their engagement on social media with a photo of their daughter's hand, the engagement ring on her finger.</p><p class=dh>The couple has not updated fans on a wedding date since their engagement announcement, seeing as they are in no rush to tie the knot. The duo is already happily raising their daughter together, making marriage but a formality.</p><p class=dh>Before <a class="me a" href=#>Linda Cardellini </a>and Steven's romance took off, the actress was in a relationship with her "Freaks and Geeks" co-star, Jason Segal. The show, where he played Nick Andopolis, only lasted a year, but their relationship lasted five years.</p><p class=dh>Although their love story ended, it inspired the comedy "Forgetting Sarah Marshall," which, according to Segal, had an opening scene similar to their breakup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcG5naHqttcuan2aqn6iybr7Onamin6Wax260xKWnnpxdnbKzec%2BaqZ6mpKh7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juwan-howard-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Juwan Howard Net Worth: Careers &amp;amp; Quick Facts</span></a>
