The song is regarded as the first rap song ever, just ahead of the Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight”. Steve then moved to Los Angeles, California and was the manager of the R&B group called New Edition from 1986 to 1988. In 1991, Rifkind founded the new record label named Loud Records, and launched such influential hip-hop artist in the early ‘90s as <a href=#>Wu-Tang Clan</a>, <a href=#>Three 6 Mafia</a>, <a href=#>Mobb Deep</a> and <a href=#>Big Pun</a>, all of whom helped to add to Steve’s increasing net worth.</p><p>In addition to making records and promoting, Rifkind’s company also lsunched a clothing line, and film division, both of which have significantly increased his wealth.</p><p>In 1996, he sold 50% of the company to the RCA, while three years later Loud Records moved to Sony. In 2002, Rifkind founded the Street Records Corporation, and worked with popular hip-hop figures such as <a href=#>David Banner</a> and <a href=#>Akon</a>, while in 2003 he became a Vice President of the Universal/Motown Records group. In 2008, Steve founded a technology marketing company called the Rifkind Thal Group and had numerous prestigious clients including the SanDisk, a data storage manufacturer and products inventor. Today, he is still one of the most recognizable names in the hip-hop industry, as a quite influential figure in promoting and advertising.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Steve Rifkind has two sons and a daughter with now ex-wife Nicole Lamy, and ex- model and now interior designer.</p><p>He is a well-known philanthropist who co-founded a week-long overnight camp for underprivileged children who have problems with learning disabilities. Additionally, Rifkind donates a lot of money to breast cancer charities.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=4.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=7><td>1</td><td>Pioneer record label head.
