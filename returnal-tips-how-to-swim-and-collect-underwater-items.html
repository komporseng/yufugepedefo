They are unlocked when players beat the fifth biome – Fractured Wasted. Fortunately, players can’t miss getting the Hadal Ballasts, as their unlock is part of the story like the Atropian Blade and Icarian Grapnel. Selene will stumble upon a corpse and will add them to her suit, as was the case with previous power-ups.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>FIFA 22 review: How the gameplay has improved significantly from FIFA 21</a></p><p>Once players get the Hadal Ballasts, all they need to do is jump into these pools of water and they will be able to sink to the bottom, enabling them to pick items that they wanted for so long. To pick these items, players need to simply press Triangle when they are standing by them, just as they would any other item.</p><p>When players are done swimming and picking all underwater items in the game, they will have to press X to jump back out of the water and continue on with their adventure.
