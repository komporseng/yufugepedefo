She shared a picture of the young man a while back.</p><p class=Eg>Taking to Instagram, Jackie posted a photo of her look-alike son, Doug Christie Jr. The young man, who looks a lot like his father, wore a black turtleneck sweater and glanced sideways at the camera.</p><p class=Eg>Jackie, who recently <a class="Sd a" href=#>unveiled</a> her new bald look, revealed in the caption that Doug Jr inherited not just his father’s facial features, but also his height.</p><p class=Eg>“Our Young King..#DougIeJr even at 6’4 he’s still our Baby,” the proud mom wrote.</p><p class=Eg>The reality star and her husband have even more cause to be proud because, according to ILOSM, the young man is also <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.iloveoldschoolmusic.com/slideshow/bbw-star-jackie-christie-debuts-bald-head-son-many-never-knew/8/>following </a>in Doug’s basketball footsteps. He plays for the Granite Bay Grizzlies at Granite Bay High School in California.</p><p class=Eg>Sadly, although Jackie seems to be very close to her son, the same cannot be said of her relationship with her daughters, especially her oldest, Takari Lee.</p><p><h3 class=Jg>MOTHER-DAUGHTER FEUD</h3></p><p class=Eg>When Jackie, 49, <a class="Sd a" href=#>married</a> Doug in 1996, she had a six-year-old daughter, Takari, from a previous relationship. Takari <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://liverampup.com/entertainment/things-should-know-jackie-christie-happy-married-life-husband-rocky-relationship-daughter.html>reportedly</a> lived with Jackie’s mother until she died in 2012 and her relationship with her biological mother is at best, strained.</p><p class=Eg>On various occasions, Takari has accused her author/entrepreneur mom of having issues with her because of her dark complexion and weight, amongst other things.</p><p class=Eg>Their rocky relationship was further exposed in 2017 when Takari’s son was burned at daycare, and she set up a GoFundMe campaign to cover the medical expenses.</p><p class=Eg>Takari claimed that her mother refused to help with her grandson’s treatment and when Jackie said she had no idea about the accident, Takari countered on Twitter:</p><p class=Eg>“Your response to tmz and the world was a month after his injuries ... So before the world found out u knew and did what u felt was right.”</p><p><h3 class=Jg>SISTER-SISTER FEUD</h3></p><p class=Eg>Besides Jackie, Takari also doesn’t have the best of relationships with her younger sister, Jackie and Doug’s daughter, Chantel.</p><p class=Eg>Last year, Takari reached out to Chantel with a message on her 25th birthday, but things <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://madamenoire.com/1027980/takari-lee-chantel-christie/>turned ugly</a> very quickly.</p><p class=Eg>“I don’t care what’s going on or what have [sic] changed. What will always remain the same is my LOVE for you,” wrote the 28-year-old.</p><p class=Eg>Instead of a sweet “Thank You” note as anyone might have expected, Chantel fired off a scathing reply to her sister, calling her out on her “sad, sappy charade.”</p><p class=Eg>The budding singer further accused:</p><p class=Eg>“I’m not with the public shenanigans anymore, that’s why I’ve been quiet. I don’t have no ill wishes toward you but this ain’t genuine and you know that. You put this up for your followers and the blogs. … I’VE BEEN THERE for you and dare you to say otherwise. I stopped [expletive] with you off the strength of YOU and YOUR poor decisions. Has nothing to do with Mom. … YOU call me when you [sic] ready to be real and own up to the [expletive] TAKARI has done. Not Jackie. TAKARI. Until then, please don’t speak about me, on the internet or otherwise.”</p><p class=Eg>In defending herself, Takari claimed she had been reaching out to her sister for a year without getting any response, but there has been no update on the two’s relationship since then.</p><p class=Eg>Hopefully, they all get back to being one, big, happy family soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpqaWphZXqzscyepJudomKvor%2FKnqubmZyheri11Z6qZqKRmLiqsYycn6uho6m2b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./one-punch-man-chapter-180-release-date-expected-plot-previous-chapter-review.html><span>←</span><span>One Punch Man Chapter 180 Release Date: Expected Plot | Previous Chapter Review!</span></a>
