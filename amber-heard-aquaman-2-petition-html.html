The number&nbsp;on the signature counter looks to be ever-increasing.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Change.org petition to remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2&nbsp;after defamation trial against Johnny Depp.</strong><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> (Photo: Change.org) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Someone named Jeanne Larson started the petition to "SVP of Publicity & Communications for DC Warner Bros." It first came to life in December 2019, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Newsweek</a>, just weeks after Depp sued his now-ex wife Heard for $50 million. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The page comprises a long text explaining exactly the reasons one should sign the petition. The writing starts by writing&nbsp;that Heard has been "exposed as a domestic abuser by Johnny Depp."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>It then mentions the incidents where Heard "punched him twice in the face" and "where she shattered his finger with a vodka bottle, and his finger had to be surgically reattached." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The writing further says that since their divorce, she has "systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood." She attempted this by fabricating multiple accounts of abuse and an op-ed in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Washington Post</a>, and even said Depp himself cut his finger off.</p><p>"As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman 2 film project," the petition demands. "They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser."</p><p>"Do the right thing. Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2," the petition concludes. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The current target for the petition seems to be three million signatures, at which point, as the page claims, it will become "one of the top signed on Change.org!"</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Other Things Regarding Amber Heard’s Removal from ‘Aquaman 2’</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Aquaman 2, or Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, started production on June 28, 2021. James Wan, the director of the movie, was one of the people to announce the start.</p><p>Just hours after his announcement, producer Peter Safran, while talking to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Deadline</a>, revealed how much impact social media campaigns for Heard's removal had on the production. The answer — none. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"I don’t think we’re ever going to react to, honestly, pure fan pressure," Safran said at the time. "You gotta do what’s best for the movie."</p><p>The production team felt that if Wan and <a href=# rel=follow>Jason Momoa</a> were to stay with the franchise, so would Heard. He admitted he was aware of the petitions and campaigns, but he did not take those things into consideration. Meanwhile, a year later, the campaigns have only gotten stronger.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As for the trial, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">everything started</a> with Heard's 2018 op-ed on The Washington Post, where she claimed she was a victim of domestic violence but did not name any names, including Depp's. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Depp, however, sued Heard for defamation, claiming the op-ed was a ruse to gather positive press for herself. He also claimed that Heard was not the victim but the perpetrator of domestic violence. He sought $50 million in damages. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After a libel case against The Sun in 2020, after the publication had called him a "wife-beater," which he lost, Depp was asked to resign from the Fantastic Beasts franchise. He complied.</p><p>In 2021, Heard counter-sued Depp for $100 million, and on April 11, 2022, their ongoing defamation trial kicked off.</p><p>On April 19, Depp took the stand and testified to the court. <a href=# rel=follow>The case</a> is still ongoing, and with Heard left to take the stand, the public awaits further revelations. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmdl7KzeceemKucXZa%2Btq3MmqVmal2lsrW106Kmp2aYqbqt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patterns-scanned-at-a-store-checkout-2-wds-html.html><span>←</span><span>Patterns scanned at a store checkout: 2 wds.</span></a>
