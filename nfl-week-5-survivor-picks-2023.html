However, their inability to maintain their lead in the latter half of their games is a concern. The Commanders, though slipping to a 2-2, showcased grit by tying the game during crunch time. Injuries to Martin and Dotson could be pivotal in determining their play.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Considering the Bears’ recent form and potential injuries for Washington, Justin Fields might be a valuable pick given his impressive yardage last game.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: It might be a bit risky to rely on Martin and Dotson until their playing status is clarified.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Jacksonville_Jaguars_at_Buffalo_Bills><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars at Buffalo Bills</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Jaguars showed their resilience against the Falcons, and Lawrence seems to be settling in. The Bills, on the other hand, look dominant, and Allen-Diggs seems to be a potent duo.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Allen and Diggs from the Bills due to their recent form. Lawrence might be a value pick from the Jaguars.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Agnew’s injury status needs monitoring, and the potential absence of Tre’Davious White in the Bills secondary might hurt their defense.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Houston_Texans_at_Atlanta_Falcons><strong>Houston Texans at Atlanta Falcons</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Texans, with their recent upset, are looking promising. C.J. Stroud’s performance makes him an interesting prospect. The Falcons, though, seem to be struggling, especially in their passing game.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Stroud and Collins from the Texans. Robinson from the Falcons due to his consistent running.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Considering the recent form, relying too much on the Falcons’ passing game might be a risk.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Carolina_Panthers_at_Detroit_Lions><strong>Carolina Panthers at Detroit Lions</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Panthers are struggling, with Young under constant pressure. The Lions, with their win against the Packers, seem to be in better form.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Goff and Montgomery from the Lions. Montgomery’s performance, even when questionable, makes him a notable pick.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Panthers’ offensive line struggles might make their offensive players a risky pick.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tennessee_Titans_at_Indianapolis_Colts><strong>Tennessee Titans at Indianapolis Colts</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: Henry remains the heart of the Titans’ offense, with his multifaceted role. The Colts showed determination in their recent game, tying it up in the second half.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Derrick Henry due to his consistent performances. Richardson from the Colts due to his all-around play.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Injuries to Whyle and Flowers need monitoring before making a decision.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=New_York_Giants_at_Miami_Dolphins><strong>New York Giants at Miami Dolphins</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Giants’ form will be clearer after their game against the Seahawks. Dolphins, after their dominant start, were humbled by the Bills.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Barkley, if he returns, remains a key pick. Achane is from the Dolphins due to his recent running form.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: The Dolphins’ defense after their recent drubbing.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=New_Orleans_Saints_at_New_England_Patriots><strong>New Orleans Saints at New England Patriots</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: Both teams seem to be struggling. The Patriots were notably poor in their last game, and the Saints couldn’t find the end zone against the Buccaneers.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Given the recent performances, there doesn’t seem to be a standout pick.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: The QBs of both teams, until they show some consistency.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Baltimore_Ravens_at_Pittsburgh_Steelers><strong>Baltimore Ravens at Pittsburgh Steelers</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Ravens are flying high, especially with Jackson’s form. The Steelers, however, are in a pickle with injuries to their starting QB and other key players.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Lamar Jackson due to his dual-threat capabilities.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Pickett’s playing status needs monitoring.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Philadelphia_Eagles_at_Los_Angeles_Rams><strong>Philadelphia Eagles at Los Angeles Rams</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Eagles remain undefeated and have showcased a solid offensive game. The Rams managed to secure a win but almost blew a significant lead.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown from the Eagles.

While the Bengals were blanked in the last three-quarters of their recent game, the Cardinals couldn’t maintain their first-half lead against the 49ers.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Given the inconsistent forms, there’s no standout pick. Higgins might be a value pick if he’s fit.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Until more clarity, relying too much on either team’s passing game might be a risk.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=New_York_Jets_at_Denver_Broncos><strong>New York Jets at Denver Broncos</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Broncos finally found their rhythm against the Bears, while the Jets are still searching for consistency.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Russell Wilson, after his recent form.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: The status of injured players, especially Williams from the Broncos, needs checking.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Kansas_City_Chiefs_at_Minnesota_Vikings><strong>Kansas City Chiefs at Minnesota Vikings</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points:</strong> The Chiefs got back to winning ways, and the Mahomes-Kelce duo is looking formidable. The Vikings, after a strong start, fell short in their recent game.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce due to their connection. Smith-Marsette from the Vikings due to his recent form.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Depending on the injury news, potentially avoiding Dalvin Cook might be wise.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Green_Bay_Packers_at_Seattle_Seahawks><strong>Green Bay Packers at Seattle Seahawks</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Packers lost against the Lions, which might have shaken their confidence. The Seahawks’ game against the Giants will be pivotal in assessing their form.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Russell and Metcalf from the Seahawks due to their consistent form.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Until clarity, relying too much on the Packers’ passing game might be risky.</li></ul><p>This expanded breakdown provides an overview of the key players and trends for each game.
