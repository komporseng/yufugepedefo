しかし、ただ一人だけ若い頃と変わらない美しさをキープしてるメンバーがいるのです。
ファンからは「ピーターパン」とも囁かれているベースのJIROさんです。
ヴィジュアル系は出始めから全盛期のビジュアルが絶賛されがちですが、JIROさんの場合はその逆のようで、昔よりもおじさんになってからの方が美しいとの声が多いのです。
GLAY・JIROの現在の髪型とファッション JIROさんは一般的にも受ける正統派イケメンというイメージがありますが、それは2000年代の後半になってから。
実のJIROさんは若い頃はコテコテのビジュアル系でありました。レザーのパンツに革ジャン、厳ついブーツと、今のJIROさんからは想像もできないような衣装を着ていました。
JIROさんは2010年前後から一般ウケの良さそうなナチュラルなイケメンと変貌を遂げました。
これまでのザ・ヴィジュアル系なイメージを一新するような外見となりました。
その時期以降、髪型もファッションも現在のトレンドに逆らわない、自然な外見となりました。
現在、2020年代のJIROさんは、流行りのショートヘアーで、ファッションもシンプルな原色などが増えました。
まるでモデルか俳優さんのようです。
90年代から活動してるヴィジュアル系のバンドマンは現時点で年齢が出て、全盛期のような色気を失ってるような方が多いですが、JIROさんだけは変わらずに守り続けています。
また、登山にハマったり、ジャンルの違うチャットモンチーのライブを観に行ったり、JIROさんの私生活はヴィジュアル系とは思えないほどにカジュアルです。
JIROの通ってる美容院の名前は「Fatsberry」谷やんのお店 ここ数年はずっとショートヘアーのJIROさん。
男性ファンでも真似しやすいトレンドの髪型が多いので、真似してみたいと思ってる方も多いようです。
ちなみにJIROさんが通ってる美容院は「Fatsberry」という名前のお店。
この美容院の美容師の谷崎隆幸さんで、「通称：谷やん」と呼ばれてます。
普段はJIROさんの専属のヘアメイクなどを担当してるので、JIROさんの髪型にしたいのであれば、この方に切ってもらって、ヘアセットの仕方まで色々と聞いてみるとよいでしょう。
現在のJIROはコンバースのスニーカーをヘビロテ 若い頃はブーツや派手な色使いのスニーカーを履くことが多かったJIROさんですが、カジュアルになった現在はどのような靴を履いてるのでしょうか？
色々と調べてみると、現在のJIROさんはコンバースのスニーカーをたくさん所持し、ヘビロテしているみたいです。
私服から衣装までスニーカーが多い印象。
今の髪型や衣装から考えると、ブーツよりもスニーカーの方が合わせやすようですね。
JIROはタトゥーを入れないと宣言 GLAYといえば、JIROさん意外の全メンバーがタトゥーを入れています。
若い頃から各メンバーちょっとずつタトゥーを増やしてるみたいですが、JIROさんは唯一タトゥーに興味がないみたいです。
過去に今後もタトゥーは入れないと宣言されているので、きっとこれからも入れることはなさそうです。
やはり子供もいるので、入れない施設とかあったら嫌ですもんね。嫁さんも良い大学を出て大手に就職したエリートなので、旦那の刺青には絶対に反対してることでしょう。
今後も、JIROさんがタトゥーを入れる可能性は限りなく低いと思います。
過去のJIROの髪型とファッション。若い頃は挑戦的？ GLAYが世に出た時代は、まだまだヴィジュアル系バンドは多く存在しました。
楽曲のセンスが素晴らしく、メンバーの技術も洗練されていたということでGLAYはすぐに人気バンドとなりました。
昔のヴィジュアル系はかっこよくメイクや衣装を決め込んでるケースが多く、GLAYもその類ではありましたが、時には個性的な表現もありました。
JIROさんは顔が小さくスタイルも良かったということで、他のバンドのメンバーにはいないような個性を作るのに大いに貢献していました。
若い頃のJIROのファッションと髪型：90年代中盤は極端なショート 今でこそ普通の髪型のJIROさんですが、デビュー当時はなかなか個性的でありました。
昔はヴィジュアル系が多く世に出てたので差別化するために必死だったんでしょうね。
ファッションも当時のビジュアル系を象徴する全身ブラックやレザーが主流でした。
こうやってみると、今のGLAYと全然違いますね・・・。
メンバー全員細いですが、当時は全員がタイトな衣装だったのでJIROさんの細さはなおさら際立ってました。
若い頃のJIROのファッションと髪型：黒歴史？個性的な「アロエヘア」90年代後半 バンドの楽曲がガンガン売れだすと、地上波の音楽番組にも登場しました。
この時期からGLAYは世間一般的に知られていったと思います。
そんな時期のJIROさんの髪型は、超個性的でありました。
まるでアトムのように量の多い髪をカチカチと上に尖らせた髪型です。
ファンの間では植物のアロエに例えられ「アロエヘア」と呼ばれました。
ちなみにライブ衣装も個性的でありました。
メディアに登場するときの衣装はもう少し普通だったので、ライブでは何かテーマがあったことでしょう。
ちなみにこの時期にダウンタウンさんの音楽番組で、JIROさんはまんまといじられていました。
若い頃のJIROのファッションと髪型：流行りの王道イケメンへ。00年代前半 バンドが全盛期を迎えた2000年代。各メンバーの外見が洗練されていきました。
JIROさんも変化が著しく、当時の若者の間で流行った髪型を完璧に取り入れてました。
当時は木村拓哉さんがトレンドの一角を担っており、JIROさんはツイストパーマや外ハネなど、その名残のある髪型を完璧に取り入れてました。
衣装も90年代よりもアイテム１品の風合いを大事にした、落ち着いたファッションが増えたように感じます。
若い頃のJIROのファッションと髪型：最もGLAYのヴィジュアルレベルが良かった？2000年代後半 2000年代後半の日本はギャル男という文化が流行り、歌舞伎町にはヴィジュアル系とギャル男の要素を織り混ぜたホストが多く誕生しました。芸能界でも亀梨和也や赤西仁などが人気でありました。
2000年代後半のややチャラチャラしたトレンドに対して、GLAYはとてもハマりました。
この時代ならジャニーズにいてもおかしくないですし、ホストにいてもおかしくない風貌です。</description></item><item><title>Annalise Basso - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts, Career, Single</title><link>/annalise-basso.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/annalise-basso.html</guid><description>Table of Biography

このタイミングの公表には驚いたことでしょう。
それはGACKTさんの本名公表と、
仮想通貨事業への参加です。
今日、GACKTさんは自身のブログを更新し、
これまでの実業家とミュージシャンとしての思想を語り、
自分の本名を公開して仮想通貨事業に参加したことを明かしました。
過去にもいろんなところで、
音楽家の将来の危なさを語っていましたが、
難しい言葉が多く、イメージが難しかったです。
しかし、今日更新したブログの中では、
簡潔にわかりやすく語られており、
これまでイマイチ理解できなかった点もしっかりと伝わりました。
それでも１０年後の銀行の未来など、
過激に憶測も多くあり、想像以上に大きなニュースになっています。
そもそも公表した本名が、
「大城ガクト」というのは、
これまで応援してきたファンも驚いたことでしょう。
GACKTが本名公表。大城ガクトに改名？「岡部」「学」は本当か嘘か 今日GACKTさんが公開したブログ記事のタイトルは、
「大城ガクトと仮想通貨」でした。
ブログの内容を読んでみると、
そのタイトルのままに、
本名で仮想通貨の事業に出ることを明かしました。
GACKTさんの本名といえば、
これまで噂されていたのは、
苗字で「岡部」と「大城」で、
名前は「学（サトル）」でした。
大城の部分はそのままですが、
下の名前の「学」ではなくて、
「ガクト」になっている点、驚いてる方が多いみたいです。
本名に関してはかなり昔からネットで囁かれており、
親の都合で、岡部から大城に変わった説もあります。
結局「大城」が事実だったことと、
それをあっさり明かしたことが驚きです。
「学」という名前の説はネット上の嘘だったのでしょうか？
もしくは、ガクトに名前を正式に改名したのか、
その部分で引っかかってる方が多いみたいです。
大城まで的中していれば、
自動的に「学」も的中しそうですが、
もしや、ここだけ間違っていたのかも？
そもそも今回のGACKTさんのブログの本題は、
本名が云々というよりも、仮想通貨の話です。
それでも、世間の関心は本名の方に向いてるようで、
今トレンドになってるキーワードも「GACKT 本名」ばかりです。
過去の事業と仮想通貨 これまで実業家としての顔もあったGACKTさんですが、
どの事業も名前を出しては行いませんでした。
ファンがダイレクトに知ることができたのは、
サングラスやアクセサリーやアパレル、（ダーツやピラーズ）
そして、飲食やそのプロデュース関係です。
公に知ることのできた事業のほとんどが、
誰が大元なのかよくわかりませんでしたが、
サングラスはスポーツ選手にウケ、
アクセサリーはシルバー好きの層にもウケていました。
もともとアイディア力の強い方だったので、
何かしら成功はしてるでしょうが、
具体的に何で成功されているかは謎でした。
これから実業家としてオープンに動くということで、
これまで世間が感じていた「なんでお金持ってるの？」の疑問は、
あっさりと解けていくことでしょう。
今年の元旦に格付けで共演された実業家のホリエモンさんは、
ラジオの中で、GACKTさんのラスビジュのライブを鑑賞後に、
楽屋でGACKTさん本人に直接番組のオファーを受けたそうです。
ラジオの中でもGACKTさんのガチさを訴えていたホリエモンさんですが、
かなり自然とリスペクトされている印象でした。</description></item><item><title>Gong Li Net Worth</title><link>/gong-li-net-worth.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gong-li-net-worth.html</guid><description>Gong Li net worth is
