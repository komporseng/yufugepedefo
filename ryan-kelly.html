His parents, Chris and Doreen Kelly, had him as their first child. In his family, he has a younger brother named Sean and a younger sister named Erin.</p><p>Despite the fact that Ryan was a resident of Caramel, he began his education at the local school.

Doreen, his mother, has been the head of school at Ravenscroft since 2003.</p><p>Ryan’s parents were sports fans, in addition to being a well-educated family. Doreen, his mother, was a former University of Pennsylvania volleyball player.</p><p>Similarly, Chris, his father, was a professional basketball player who spent three seasons in the French league. As a result, he was motivated to participate in athletics from a young age.</p><p>Sean, his younger brother, was only two years younger than he was, and he enjoyed playing with him. As a result, they grew up together playing basketball. Chris, his father, joined in the fun and assisted his young sons in honing their basketball abilities.</p><h2>A Professional Life</h2><p>Kelly was the 48th overall choice in the second round of the 2013 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers.
