She got the job thanks to her dad&nbsp;<strong>Timothy&nbsp;Van Patten</strong>, who directed both episodes.

We had a kickoff dinner with the whole cast, and everyone was so great—there’s no shortage of humor [in that group], and it always helped.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Grace-Van-Patten-tell-me-lies-embed2.jpg><h2>She was romantically linked to Nat Wolff.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Grace started dating&nbsp;The Naked Brothers Band&nbsp;star <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nat Wolff</strong></a>, 27, sometime in 2017.

Her dad Tim Van Patten is a famous director who worked on hit shows like The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, Sex and the City, and Game of Thrones.
