She sat down and talked about her experience with making the movie, including the character she portrayed. The blonde beauty plays an “American psychiatrist who travels to a remote plantation in Colombia in the 1890s to treat a disturbed boy and finds herself in a war of science versus religion with the local priest who believes the child is possessed by the devil,” according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/amber-heard-first-red-carpet-2019-backgrid-embed2.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You don’t to them for money, you do them because you love them,” Amber said on stage, when asked&nbsp;the difference between working on an independent production like&nbsp;In The Fire and a Hollywood blockbuster, Deadline reported. “You do them because you love the story, you love the people, and you want to be part of that experience and have be something that other people can experience.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Amber’s latest public outing comes years after she made her red carpet appearance at the Gully premiere at Tribeca Film Festival and one year after the headline-making <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>defamation trial</a>, in which she went up against her ex-husband <strong>Johnny Depp</strong>, who sued her for writing a Washington Post editorial in which she revealed she was an alleged victim of “domestic abuse.” After the jury ruled mostly in Johnny’s favor, Amber moved to Spain and has been living there ever since.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Earlier this month, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ </a>reported that Johnny had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>received $1 million in damages</a> from Amber after they agreed on a settlement.
